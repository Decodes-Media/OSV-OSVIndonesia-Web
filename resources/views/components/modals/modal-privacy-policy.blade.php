                        <h5>Privacy Policy</h5>

                        <p>
                            The purpose of this Policy is to inform you how OSV Indonesia (referred to as “we,” “our,” “us,” “OSV”) collects, records, uses, accesses, handles, stores, transfers, and discloses your personal data so that you can make informed choices before submitting your personal data to us. OSV Indonesia is committed to maintaining your personal data in compliance with the relevant data protection legislations, which include, but are not limited to, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (PDPA) of Singapore. By providing your personal data to us, you are explicitly consenting (which consent overrides any registration with the Singapore Do-Not-Call Registry, if applicable) to allow OSV Indonesia to process your personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. The use of the word “processing” in this Policy is intended to include such actions as collecting, recording, handling, using, storing, transferring, and disclosing your personal data.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Personal Data Collected</h5>

                        <p>
                            Personal data may refer to any online or offline information, whether true or not, that identifies a person or makes a person identifiable. This includes, but is not limited to names, addresses, usernames and passwords, photographs, social security numbers, personal identification numbers, financial data, and employment-related information.

                        <p>
                            In order to consider you for employment or employ you, we need to process certain information about you. We only collect details that help us provide what is required as part of your application process or employment. For example, we need information such as your name, age, contact details, education details, employment history, emergency contacts, and other relevant information required for the purposes of your employment or that you may choose to share with us. Where appropriate, and in accordance with local laws and requirements, we may also collect information of a more sensitive nature, such as diversity information, information related to your health, or details of any criminal convictions. If you are providing OSV Indonesia with your personal data for the purposes of a job application and/or job inquiries, the personal data that you provide may also be used for the purposes listed in the Career Page and the Personal Data Notice and Consent Page.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Website Users:</h5>

                        <p>
                            We do not collect personal data that can identify anonymous users on our website. We collect a limited amount of information to help improve your experience when using our website. This includes anonymous information such as the frequency with which you access our website, and the times that our website is most visited; we will not be able to identify you from this data.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            OSV Indonesia will ask our website users for their personal data only if they wish to stay in touch, provide feedback about any of our products or services, download our brochures, or seek employment opportunities with us (see above for more information on employees and job applicants). For these users, OSV Indonesia may process your personal data for the following purposes:
                        </p>

                            <li>Personal identification and verification,</li>

                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            If you do not provide the information requested, this may limit our ability to respond to your request(s) or feedback may be limited. OSV Indonesia will first seek your permission if we wish to process your personal data for any other purposes.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Disclosure of Personal Data to Third Parties</h5>

                        <p>
                            OSV Indonesia's objective is to use the information you provide to better understand your requirements and provide information to you on products and services that are most relevant to you. In order to achieve this objective, as well as other legal, regulatory, and contractual obligations, we may need to share some personal data we process with third parties. These third parties may be located within or outside your country. They will be required to keep your information confidential and use it only for the purposes for which we are permitted to use it. The list below contains a description of the types of organizations with which we may need to share some of the personal data we process:

                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            OSV Indonesia will not sell, rent or trade your personal information. We have put in place reasonable measures to ensure that any necessary transfer of personal data cross border is protected and complies with the applicable data protection laws.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Retention of Personal Data</h5>

                        <p>
                            OSV Indonesia will retain your personal data for a reasonable period for the purposes for which it was obtained or until you request OSV Indonesia to delete your personal data (if the circumstances allow) or as required by law, whichever arrives first. Retention of specific records may be necessary for one or more of the following reasons:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Fulfilling statutory or other regulatory requirements,</li>
                            <li>Evidencing events/agreements in case of disputes,</li>

                        </ul>

                        <h5>Withdrawal of Consent</h5>

                        <p>
                            In situations where we request and receive your consent to process your personal data, you can exercise your right to withdraw your consent at any time by writing to the PDPA Officer. Withdrawal of consent to allow us to send you marketing material can also be made by clicking on the unsubscribe option at the bottom of each marketing email sent to you. Please note that if you have subscribed to more than one list, unsubscribing from that list will not automatically unsubscribe you from another list if you are also subscribed to it. Withdrawal of consent cannot be backdated so it has no effect on processing already performed during the period of consent. Please note that withdrawal of consent might affect OSV Indonesia’s ability to either respond to your request(s) or provide important service notifications in the future.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Data Security</h5>

                        <p>
                            OSV Indonesia has put in place robust policies and security arrangements to protect the personal data it processes from misuse, loss, and unauthorized access. OSV Indonesia ensures that only authorized employees and necessary third parties have access to personal data held by us. However, no electronic system can be entirely secured from unauthorized invasion. Accordingly, OSV Indonesia cannot guarantee the absolute security of any personal data.
